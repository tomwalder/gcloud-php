/**
 * Google Cloud Platform is a set of modular cloud-based services that allow you
 * to create anything from simple websites to complex applications.
 *
 * This API aims to expose access to these services in a way that is intuitive
 * and easy to use for PHP enthusiasts. The ServiceBuilder instance exposes
 * factory methods which grant access to the various services contained within
 * the API.
 *
 * Configuration is simple. Pass in an array of configuration options to the
 * constructor up front which can be shared between clients or specify the
 * options for the specific services you wish to access, e.g. Datastore, or
 * Storage.
 *
 * Please note that all examples below take advantage of
 * [Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials).
